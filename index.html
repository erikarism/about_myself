  <h2 id="bio" , id="boarder">Bio</h2>
  <p>
    Aspiring JavaScript Developer, currently going through a training program at Code Fellows in Seattle. Prior to my career
    change, I was in accounting. After being in that profession for 4 years, it was becoming clear that this career was not
    a good fit for me. I started coding when I was tasked at my last accounting job to make a few macros (Excel programs).
    After making a few macros in VBA, I realized that I enjoy coding.
